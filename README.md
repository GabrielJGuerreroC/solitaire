# Solitaire

This is a little game taken from the course Programming Languages by The
University of Washington through Coursera. The original game is developed in
the ML Programming Language.

This version was written in the C++ Programming Languages and the Library
DeSiGNAR in order to be used to learn about lists in the course
"Programaci√≥n 3" at Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela.
